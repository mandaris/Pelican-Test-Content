Definition lists are defined using the syntax established in [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#def-list "A couple of examples of what you can do.").

## Multiple terms with  the same definition

## Definitions with multiple paragraphs
Term 1

:   This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum 
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam 
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet

    because of the blank line preceding it.

# Abbreviations

This might look pretty weird when I read it.

> Also a random blockquote to change things up.

And this concludes my semi random content creation.

*[headings]: A brief one liner to separate sections of text.


*[lorem]: Some guy who owes me money
