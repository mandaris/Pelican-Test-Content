I thought I was done with making examples for the night. I couldn't call it a night until I finish the first draft of an example with code in it.

```python
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
```

## An example with highlighting

```python hl_lines="1 3"
# This line is emphasized
# This line isn't
# This line is emphasized
```

That's enough for a now.
