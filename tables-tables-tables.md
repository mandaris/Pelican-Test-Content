A couple examples of a markdown table.

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

The previous example taken from the [python-markdown table example page](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/ "A simple listing of how to use tables in markdown.").



The following is from [multimarkdown](https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/tables.html "A really good markdown library"). 

|              |          Grouping           ||
|------------  | :-----------: | -----------:|
|First Header  | Second Header | Third Header |
|Content       |          *Long Cell*        ||
|Content       |   **Cell**    |         Cell |
|New section   |     More      |         Data |
|And more      | With an escaped '\|'         ||




I hope the following work as well. It was found on a page showing [github markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables "This is the syntax that github uses for there markdown.").

| Tables        | Are             | Cool   |
| ------------- |:---------------:| ------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned   |  $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |    $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |     $1 |
